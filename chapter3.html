            <h2>3.1 Concept of Software</h2>
            <h3>3.1.1 Definition of Software</h3>
            <p>Software is a collection of programs, procedures, and related data that provide instructions to a computer. Unlike hardware, which is the physical component of a computer, software is intangible and enables the computer to perform specific tasks.</p>
            
            <h3>3.1.2 Categories of Software</h3>
            <p>Software is broadly categorized into:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>System Software:</strong> Includes operating systems and utilities that manage hardware resources.</li>
                <li><strong>Application Software:</strong> Programs designed for end users, such as word processors and web browsers.</li>
                <li><strong>Utility Software:</strong> Tools for system maintenance, such as antivirus software and file management utilities.</li>
                <li><strong>Web-Based Software:</strong> Applications that run via web browsers, such as Google Docs.</li>
                <li><strong>Mobile Apps:</strong> Applications specifically designed for smartphones and tablets.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>3.2 Concept of Operating System</h2>
            <h3>3.2.1 Introduction to Operating System</h3>
            <p>An operating system (OS) is system software that acts as an intermediary between computer hardware and the user. It manages hardware resources and provides an environment for software applications to run.</p>
            
            <h3>3.2.2 Role of Operating System</h3>
            <p>The operating system plays a crucial role in managing system resources such as memory, CPU, input/output devices, and file storage. It provides user interfaces, security features, and multitasking capabilities.</p>
            
            <h3>3.2.3 Functions of an Operating System</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Process Management</li>
                <li>Memory Management</li>
                <li>File System Management</li>
                <li>Device Management</li>
                <li>Security and Access Control</li>
                <li>User Interface Provision</li>
            </ul>
