        <h1>Chapter 8: Information Security and Cyber Law</h1>
        <p>Information security involves protecting information and information systems from unauthorized access, disclosure, modification, or destruction. Cyber law encompasses the legal aspects related to the internet and digital technologies, addressing issues such as cybercrimes and electronic commerce.</p>
        
        <h2>Information Security</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Confidentiality:</strong> Ensuring that information is accessible only to those authorized to have access.</li>
            <li><strong>Integrity:</strong> Safeguarding the accuracy and completeness of information and processing methods.</li>
            <li><strong>Availability:</strong> Ensuring that authorized users have access to information and associated assets when required.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>Cyber Threats</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Malware:</strong> Malicious software designed to disrupt, damage, or gain unauthorized access to computer systems.</li>
            <li><strong>Phishing:</strong> Fraudulent attempts to obtain sensitive information by disguising as a trustworthy entity in electronic communications.</li>
            <li><strong>Denial-of-Service (DoS) Attacks:</strong> Attempts to make a machine or network resource unavailable to its intended users by overwhelming it with traffic.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>Cyber Law in Nepal</h2>
        <p>Nepal has implemented several legal frameworks to address cyber-related issues and enhance cybersecurity:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Electronic Transactions Act 2063 (2008):</strong> Provides a legal framework to regulate electronic transactions and prevent cybercrime. The act includes provisions for digital signatures, intellectual property, electronic records, and electronic commerce. It also defines various cyber offenses, such as hacking, unauthorized access, data theft, cyber fraud, and cyber harassment, prescribing penalties for cybercriminals and remedies for victims. :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}</li>
            <li><strong>Cyber Security Byelaw 2077 (2020):</strong> Introduced by the Nepal Telecommunications Authority (NTA) under the Telecommunications Act, this byelaw aims to implement cybersecurity standards, protecting ICT infrastructure and information systems from malicious attacks. It mandates regular security audits for Telecommunication and Internet Service Providers, promoting a robust cybersecurity ecosystem. :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}</li>
            <li><strong>National Cybersecurity Policy 2016:</strong> Drafted by the Ministry of Information and Communications Technology, this policy aims to govern and address global challenges in cyberspace. It proposes the establishment of the National Cyber Security Strategy Working Group and the National Computer Emergency Response Team (CERT) of Nepal, responsible for providing cybersecurity services to various entities, including the government, law enforcement agencies, businesses, and the public. :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}</li>
